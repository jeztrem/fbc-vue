        and to invite others to do the same. His own trek has

        The Love of Christ Children's Center and School is located in an impoverished area of rural Western Kenya in the
        Luucho Village near the town of Bungoma. In this area many children have lost one or both of their parents and
        are with little or no means of support. The Center began in 2007 with a desire to provide hope for a few of
        these
        helpless little ones by supporting their physical and spiritual needs. FBC partnered with Mustard Seed
        Evangelical
        Minitries and Fredrick N. Mulei to begin this project.

      <h5>Arkadiy</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I was born in Uzhgorod, Ukraine, located in the Carpathian Mountains. In 1997 I entered the Odessa National
          Academy of Food Technologies, in the department of Automatic Control of Technological Processes where I
          received both a bachelor’s degree and a specialist’s degree in process control engineering. I have been on
          staff with International Messengers since 2002.
          I was saved at the age of 12 years through Danish missionaries who came to my hometown in 1992. But I really
          wasn’t living out my Christian walk until I turned 14. Only then did I fully realize what I believed and
          started living it out.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h5>Anneke</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I was born in South Africa and moved to Ukraine in 2001 with my missionary parents. After graduating from
          homeschooling I served with Ebenezer for nine months, working with the Jews in Ukraine. I came on staff with
          IM in 2005 after marrying Arkadiy in 2004.
          I was raised in a Christian home and was saved when I was six years old, but I never really fully lived out my
          walk with the Lord. When I was 16 years old God really moved me and shook my life. Then I really realized what
          Christ had come to do for me personally. Ever since that time He has been working in me, molding and making
          me. This is challenging, and at times very difficult.

        Our family: Zhenya, Lidiya, Matthew and Olivia, are now moved to Kazakhstan, the south part of the country,
        which is the most muslim and traditional. God blessed and we made all paperwork and got permanent residency
        for 10 years. Currently we are serving at the small Kazakh church. All of Kazakh believers that we serve with
        are very first generation of followers of Jesus who came from muslim culture. The biggest need here is not
        information, but living people who would live with them and serve with them shoulder to shoulder and show them.
        Lidiya serves with music and relational ministry with young girls. Lidiya does bakery and it helps to start
        redemptive relationships. Zhenya helps with training kazakh believers, future leaders in what he can.
        10 years of full time ministry in Odessa team equipped us well for God's calling in Asia. Zhenya does bible
        groups,
        discipleship meetings, training guys how to preach, and learns a lot from them as well. We hope to start
        Summer English hiking ministry and looking for people to join us. God has doors in Kazakhstan opened and
        we want to use every second of time He has been giving to us. Please pray for us and leave us message we
        would really like to hear that people are remembering us in their prayers.
